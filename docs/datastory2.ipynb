    "By comparison, the vast majority of countries, especially in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia, remained largely dependent on fossil fuels or renewables, with nuclear contributing little to nothing to their energy production. These nations are represented in the darker red regions of the graph, where the percentage of nuclear electricity remains close to zero throughout the twenty-year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the global distribution of nuclear incidents tells a more complex story. The incident markers on the map, scaled by the number of direct and indirect deaths, show that catastrophic events are not exclusive to countries with the highest nuclear output. Major accidents such as Chernobyl (Ukraine) and Fukushima (Japan) stand out, both in marker size and location, reflecting their high death tolls and severity ratings on the INES scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, there is little correlation between a country’s reliance on nuclear energy and its incident frequency or severity. For example, while France maintains high nuclear use, it shows a relatively low number of deadly incidents compared to countries like Ukraine or Japan. This could suggest that policy maturity, regulatory oversight, and historical factors (such as Soviet-era reactor design in the case of Chernobyl) play a larger role in incident likelihood than energy output alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that the time-based slider in the visualization reveals no major expansion in nuclear electricity production globally after 2011, the year of the Fukushima disaster. This aligns with research by Sovacool (2011), who noted a significant decline in nuclear energy investment and public support following Fukushima. In fact, countries like Germany actively reduced their nuclear energy share post-2011, a policy shift clearly visible in the color change on the map during later years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, while incident history can impact national policy and public perception, the long-term reliance on nuclear power continues in certain regions, often driven by goals of energy independence and decarbonization. The map illustrates this ongoing tension: between the benefits of low-carbon nuclear energy and the shadow of catastrophic risk that continues to shape global nuclear discourse. -->\n"
