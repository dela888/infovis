    "One of the primary reasons nuclear energy has not been widely implemented and remains politically divisive is safety concerns. These safety concerns are not unfounded. Well known nuclear energy incidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima, which were catastrophic in their region, are often cited as reasons why widely implementing nuclear energy is a damning suggestion. \n",
