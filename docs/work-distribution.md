# Work Distribution
During this project we communicated frequently via whatsapp, zoom meetings and in person meetings. To come up with a subject one of us made a list of possibilities and voted to choose the final one. Together we came up with the arguments and divided the arguments between all team members. First every team member made visualizations for their argument which led to our draft version. After the feedback session we met up in person to take a look at all the visualizations we made so far and all started working on combining them into one story, while keeping the received feedback in mind. 

## Stijn
