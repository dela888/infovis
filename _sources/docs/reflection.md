# Reflection

<!-- On June 19th, 2025, our team received peer feedback from group A2, where we both pitched our current work. We received feedback on what was done well, as well as possible improvements.

One of the main compliments we received was that we are on the right track with our project. We also got positive feedback on the amount of text and visualizations, and one of our maps was mentioned as looking really good.

Below is a summary of feedback that were given by group A2:
One of the maps is heavily focused on the United States. Most countries are purple while only the US stands out, being yellow, which doesn't look visually appealing.
There is no clear colour palette; too many different colours are used. 
Some data visualizations look identical and overall, there are too many.

Key feedback given by the TA:
Too many plots. Try to merge the ones that are related/similar.
Try to standardize your use of colors (e.g. always use the same color for each type of energy)
Writing style and structure need to be polished.
	
The feedback from both parties was largely aligned, so we worked to incorporate it as effectively as possible. 
We scaled the map that previously focused on absolute electricity and it now shows percentage values instead. This makes it both more visually appealing and more informative.
We also merged several plots that were related, reducing overlap. Furthermore, we selected a consistent color palette that better fits the topic of nuclear energy. 
Lastly, we revised our writing to improve the structure and correct any grammar or language mistakes. -->
On June 19th, 2025, our team received peer feedback from group A2, where we both pitched our current work. We received feedback on what was done well, as well as suggestions for possible improvements.

One of the main compliments we received was that we are on the right track with our project. We also got positive feedback on the amount of text and visualizations, and one of our maps was specifically mentioned as looking really good.

Below is a summary of the feedback given by group A2:

- One of the maps is heavily focused on the United States. Most countries are shown in purple, while only the US stands out in yellow, which doesn’t look visually appealing.
- There is no clear colour palette; too many different colours are used.
- Some data visualizations look identical, and overall, there are too many.

Key feedback given by the TA:

- Too many plots – try to merge the ones that are related or similar.
- Standardize your use of colours (e.g., always use the same colour for each type of energy).
- Writing style and structure need to be polished.
- The feedback from both parties was largely aligned, so we worked to incorporate it as effectively as possible.

We made the following changes:

- Scaled the map that previously focused on absolute electricity values, so it now shows percentage values instead. This makes it both more visually appealing and more informative.
- Merged several related plots, reducing overlap and redundancy.
- Selected a consistent colour palette that better fits the topic of nuclear energy.
- Revised our writing to improve the structure and correct any grammar or language mistakes.
